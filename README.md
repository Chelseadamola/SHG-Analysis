# SHG-Analysis

This repo contains the files and scripts used in my attempt at the Splendor Hotel Group Analysis. The idea behind this project is to demonstrate my SQL, Tableau, business intelligence skills.

## DATA COLLECTION
The dataset was made available by Uchenna Splendor along with the Project brief and Dataset above

## DATA PROCESSING
SQL Server (SSMS) was used for the processing, cleaning, and data analysis in this project to extract initial insights and answers to the questions in the project brief. 

## DATA CLEANING
Several steps were taken to clean the data including:

Replacing null values to prevent data loss
Correcting spellings of several values to allow for consistency
Changing necessary data formats
Correcting wrong values
Checking for duplicates

## DATA ANALYSIS
Then, I went ahead to answer the business questions that were posed in the Project brief using several SQL functions:

Aggregate functions e.g. COUNT()and SUM()
Window functions e.g. ROW_NUMBER()
Date functions e.g. YEAR() and MONTH()
Common Table Expressions (CTE)
Logical functions e.g. CASE WHEN
Mathematical functions e.g. ROUND()
Joins
String Concatenation
